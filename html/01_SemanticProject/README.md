# Project 1: Semantic HTML

As we have learned, HTML is the language you use to express your website's structure. You can use CSS later on to add styling and layout, but your HTML should be able to be read like a written document, with each element conveying semantic meaning.

Semantic HTML (choosing an appropriate element for what that content means) is important for the following reasons:

- it makes your websites more accessible
- it makes your HTML code easier to read
- it makes it easier to select and style elements with CSS

## The Assignment

Clone or copy/paste the `index.html` and `styles.css` files in this directory to your local computer.

In this html file, all of the semantic elements have been replaced with `<div>` tags. A `<div>` is an html element used to group other elements together, but it has no semantic meaning. Your job is to replace all of the `<div>` tags in this file with an element appropriate for the content within that element.

If you choose your elements correctly, the styles in `style.css` should automatically apply to your elements and you should end up with a website that looks similar to a home page of a streaming site.
